Classes:

    Main.java {
        This is the controller class, it is the class that contains the "main" method. The
        functions related to each algorithm are called in order in this class.
    }

    Process.java {
        This class holds the attributes and methods for a process that has been passed to the
        operating system. It contains the following attributes and methods:

        Attributes (Process)

            static ArrayList<Process> allProcesses
               - Description: A static ArrayList that stores each process that is added.

            int[] attrs
               - Description: An array holding the attributes based on which different algorithms
                 would want to sort the processes. The attributes are (arrivalTime, priority, remainingBurstTime).

            ArrayList<Integer> times:
                -Holds the list of all times a process started or ended. An index which is even indicates a start time and
                an index which is odd indicates a finish time.



        Methods (Process) [not to be mistaken with Methods.java class]

            Process():
                constructor call method:
                    1- Returns a Process, and sets it's remaining burst time equal to the initial burst
                       time provided.
                    2- Initializes (this.attrs) array for the process.
                    3- Adds process to Process.allProcesses.

            void reset():
                resets the temporary values so that the values are not reused
